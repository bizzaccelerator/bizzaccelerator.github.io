# 👋 Hi, I'm Jobert Gutierrez  

### 💡 Data Enthusiast | Data Engineer | Machine Learning Engineer | MLOps Practitioner  

Welcome to **Bizzaccelerator**, my personal space for building, experimenting, and sharing **end-to-end data solutions** — from raw data ingestion to production-ready ML systems.  

---

## 🚀 What I Do  

I’m passionate about transforming data into insight and intelligence through **robust engineering practices** and **reliable automation**.  

I design and build:
- ⚙️ **Data Engineering Pipelines** — ETL/ELT workflows for analytics and machine learning  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Solutions** — predictive models and automated retraining workflows  
- 🧩 **MLOps Systems** — experiment tracking, model deployment, and monitoring at scale  

My work bridges the gap between **data science research** and **real-world production systems**.

## 📈 My Approach  

I follow a **systems-thinking mindset**:
1. Design reproducible pipelines  
2. Automate deployment and monitoring  
3. Continuously evaluate and iterate  
4. Scale insights responsibly  

I believe **data engineering** and **machine learning operations** are inseparable pillars of real-world AI systems.
